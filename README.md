# nginx-cors

## Cases

CORS headers for POST/OPTIONS needed by browsers to deal with security. This image contains curl-based health checks to check target Nginx upstream.

Itâ€™s needed when docker restarts and brakes connection with upstream (502 Bad Gateway can be so). Simple Cron and Nginx reload to try to fix it.

## Usage

Clone in and launch by docker-compose with needed TARGET_DOMAIN and HEALTHCHECK_URL (and exposed CORS_PORT as well): 

```
# cat docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
    nginx-cors:
        build: .
        image: danyanya/nginx-cors
        ports:
            - ${CORS_PORT}:80
        environment:
            - TARGET_DOMAIN=${TARGET_DOMAIN}
            - HEALTHCHECK_URL=${HEALTHCHECK_URL}
        restart: always
        command: sh /start.sh 
        logging:
            driver: "none"
# CORS_PORT=80 TARGET_DOMAIN=backend HEALTCHECK_URL=http://localhost/api/status docker-compose up
```
